# Bakersfield Mobile Repair

This was my first full website. While working my way through it, 
I learned a lot about the entire process of building a website, 
from the design process, prototyping, mobile optimization, 
debugging, and server hosting. I briefly considered starting a 
mobile device repair business but quickly realized I enjoyed 
making websites a lot more than I liked fixing devices. It was 
at this point that I started to get serious about web development. 
I also gained my first client after having fixed their office 
sign in iPad.
